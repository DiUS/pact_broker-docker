# Each of below environment variables will trigger a separate build
# this way is possible to run the tests in different configurations
# But: Because we are using `global` instead of leaving them here
#      we need to put them under env: -> matrix:
# env:
#   - PACT_BROKER_PORT=80
#   - PACT_BROKER_PORT=9999

# Global environment variables apply to all configurations, i.e. we
# don't care how the tested service behaves by varying this values

# cleans the used slaves anyway for this is also serves as documenting code
